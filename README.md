# Nextcloud docker-client
This image provides you an alpine based image for syncing your files with a remote [nextcloud server ](https://nextcloud.com/)

This image is based on the work made by: [Martin Peters](https://github.com/FreakyBytes) and [Juan Ignacio Borda](https://github.com/juanitomint)

Any comment or propblem feel free to [fill an issue](https://github.com/dontobi/nextcloud-client.rpi/issues/new) or make a PR!

## Example without settings folder
```
docker run -d --name nextcloud-client \
    -v [nextcloud-folder]:/media/nextcloud \
    -e NC_USER=[nextcloud-user] \
    -e NC_PASS=[nextcloud-password] \
    -e NC_URL=[nextcloud-server_url] \
    --restart=always \
    dontobi/nextcloud-client.rpi:latest
```

## Example with settings folder. You have to place a "exclude" file and a "unsyncfolders" file into one directory and mount it into the docker container
```
docker run -d --name nextcloud-client \
    -v [nextcloud-folder]:/media/nextcloud \
    -v [nextcloud-folder]:/settings \
    -e NC_USER=[nextcloud-user] \
    -e NC_PASS=[nextcloud-password] \
    -e NC_URL=[nextcloud-server_url] \
    --restart=always \
    dontobi/nextcloud-client.rpi:latest
```

## Example for the file "exclude" in the settings folder
```
    file1
    file2
```

## Example for the file "unsyncfolders" in the settings folder
```
    folder1
    folder2
```
